/*
 * PKG MUTANT SHOP - on-console HTTP server  (ps5-payload-dev SDK)
 * ============================================================================
 * Makes the shop INDEPENDENT of the PC: serves the web UI + a local API straight
 * from the PS5, so the dashboard tile works even with the companion PC off.
 *
 *   GET /                -> WEB_ROOT/index.html
 *   GET /<file>          -> WEB_ROOT/<file>            (assets, etc.)
 *   GET /api/health      -> {"ok":true,"on_console":true,...}
 *   GET /api/library     -> installed games (scan /mnt/ext1/homebrew/*.ffpfsc + /user/appmeta/CUSA*)
 *   GET /api/installed   -> {"installed":[...title ids...]}
 *   GET /api/storage     -> {"reachable":true,"drives":[...]}   (from the same scan)
 *   GET /api/icon/<TID>  -> that title's icon0.png              (real box art, on-console)
 *   GET /api/*           -> {}                                   (stub: UI stays happy offline)
 *
 * Binds 0.0.0.0:PORT so it's reachable as http://127.0.0.1:PORT (console browser) AND
 * http://<console-ip>:PORT (curl from the PC, for testing without touching the TV).
 *
 * Build (WSL, ps5-payload-dev SDK):  bash build-wsl.sh

/* THE ICON EXPERIMENT, AND ITS ANSWER (2026-08-26, judged on the television).
 *
 *   variant 1  /data/pkg-mutant-shop/web/assets/icon0.png      text drew, NO icon
 *   variant 2  cxml://psnotification/tex_icon_system            text drew, NO icon
 *   variant 3  /user/data/pkg-mutant-shop/web/assets/icon0.png  text drew, NO icon
 *   variant 4  file:///user/data/.../icon0.png                  text drew, NO icon
 *
 * Variant 2 is byte-for-byte etaHEN's own notify() (commands.cpp:320-343), so etaHEN's toasts
 * carry the standard system glyph too - which looks exactly like a plain one. Variant 3 used the
 * SHELL's view of our file (rewrite_for_install maps /data -> /user/data because ShellCore cannot
 * see ours), and the file is provably there. None of them drew artwork.
 *
 * CONCLUSION: the URI is not the missing piece. The notifications that DO carry artwork - Sony's
 * own "Downloading / Ready to play" - come from BGFT, which raises them itself and resolves the
 * icon from the title's registered metadata in /user/appmeta/<TID>. It is told WHICH TITLE, not
 * where a PNG lives. Carrying artwork here would need the right `type` and an app/content id in
 * the struct's leading int32s, and those values are not known. Do not guess them: a wrong type
 * that makes the shell dereference an id is not a cheap experiment.
 *
 * This costs us nothing in practice. Every install already produces Sony's own artwork
 * notifications, because our installs go through InstallByPackage into BGFT. Our toasts exist for
 * the things the system does not know about - a cheat applied, a backup mounted, rest mode safe -
 * and text is the right medium for those.
 *
 * The variants stay reachable behind GET /api/notify?icon=N so this can be retried deliberately,
 * on the television, without ever changing what the app sends by default. */

/* ================ GAME PATCHES — GoldHEN / PS-Game-Patch XML ==================
   One file per title id: <patches>/<TITLEID>.xml. Shape (measured across the real
   376-file library, nothing assumed):

     <Patch>
       <TitleID><ID>PPSA01339</ID>…</TitleID>          up to 25 ids share one patch
       <Metadata Title= Name= Note= Author= PatchVer= AppVer= AppElf= [ImageBase=]>
         <PatchList>
           <Line Type="bytes" Address="0x0059ea79" Value="e9c2f41a01"/>
   Each <Metadata> is ONE user-visible patch, and a file carries up to 59 of them —
   normally the same patch rebuilt for different AppVer values. AppVer is what makes a
   patch safe or catastrophic: it is compiled against exact code addresses.

   ADDRESS: `Address` ALREADY INCLUDES the load base. The offset is
   `Address - (ImageBase, or 0x400000 when the attribute is absent)`, and the write lands at
   runtime_base + offset. 0x400000 is the PS4/PS5 no-ASLR load address, and every reference
   implementation does exactly this: ps-patch-system `resolve_addr()` = mapbase + (addr - base)
   with `NO_ASLR_ADDR = 0x00400000`; etaHEN `(ImageBaseAddr == 0 ? NO_ASLR_ADDR_PS4 : ...)`;
   GoldHEN `addr_real = g_module_base + (addr_real - NO_ASLR_ADDR)`; shadPS4 `- 0x400000`.
   The library agrees: of 19,167 addresses in files with no ImageBase the smallest is 0x401c22
   and NOT ONE is below 0x400000 — which is what base-included addresses look like. Treating
   them as image-relative would put every PS4-style patch 0x400000 bytes too high. */

/* ---------------- power-state watcher (OBSERVE ONLY) ----------------------
 * The comment just below this block used to assert "a PS5 payload gets no suspend
 * notification". That is FALSE, and believing it shaped every rest-mode decision here.
 *
 * The firmware publishes power state into four NAMED kernel event flags that any process may
 * open by name. Proven on this console: shadowmountplus.elf - a payload we ourselves ship -
 * imports sceKernelOpenEventFlag/PollEventFlag/CloseEventFlag, and its own log shows
 * "[SHELLFLAG] monitor started (4/4 flags opened)" plus
 * "SceSystemStateMgrInfo initial=0x00000003000003E8 decoded=STATE=WORKING(0x03E8)".
 * The API shape below is taken from that project (ShadowMountPlus, GPL-3.0,
 * src/sm_shellcore_flags.c). This project is GPLv3, so that is licence-compatible reuse.
 *
 * THIS BUILD ONLY WATCHES. It stops nothing and writes nothing. Its whole purpose is to measure
 * the one number nobody has: the RUNWAY between the first pre-suspend edge and the console
 * actually powering down. Until that is measured, acting on the edge is a coin flip with a
 * kernel panic on the losing side - and the manual button already works.
 *
 * TWO HARD RULES, both load-bearing:
 *   1. wait_mode is OR (2) and the mask is ALL BITS, so we CONSUME NOTHING. A clear mode
 *      (CLEAR_ALL 0x10 / CLEAR_PAT 0x20) would eat power-transition bits out from under
 *      ShellUI mid-shutdown - the one genuine way this could wedge standby or power-off.
 *   2. A negative return means the out-pattern was NOT written. Treating that as "value is 0"
 *      corrupts delta tracking and invents transitions that never happened.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

/* The whole point of this watcher is to capture what happens as the console SHUTS DOWN, and a
   RAM ring buffer is erased by exactly the event we are trying to measure. So every entry is also
   appended to disk, immediately and synchronously.

   Why this is safe in a power transition, stated plainly:
     - It is a plain O_APPEND write to OUR OWN log file. It is not a database, not a Sony file,
       and nothing else reads it. A torn final line costs us one line, never consistency.
     - O_SYNC means the bytes are down before the call returns. Buffering would lose precisely
       the last few lines - the ones describing the shutdown.
     - It only fires on CHANGE, not on every poll. Steady state writes nothing at all, so this
       adds no I/O to normal running.
     - It appends ACROSS boots and is trimmed only at startup, so after a power-cycle the previous
       boot's shutdown lines are still there to read. That is the measurement. */

/* ---------------- filesystem API: how the app stops needing a third-party FTP -----------------
 *
 * The PC companion reads app.db, bgft.db, addcont.db and /user/appmeta through FTP, and FTP on this
 * console belongs to etaHEN (:1337) or to ftpsrv (:2121) - neither of which is ours. That is 18
 * call sites of dependency on software we do not ship, for the sake of reading files on a machine
 * where WE ALREADY RUN AS ROOT WITH AN HTTP SERVER.
 *
 * On security: this is not a new exposure, it is a smaller one. etaHEN's FTP already grants any
 * host on the network anonymous root access to the whole filesystem, with no origin check and no
 * way to switch it off without losing the install host. These routes sit behind the origin guard
 * added in 3.24.8. Once the companion no longer needs FTP at all, etaHEN's can be turned off.
 *
 * Paths must be absolute. There is deliberately no sandbox: the whole point is reading
 * /system_data/priv/mms/*.db and writing into ShadowMount's scan folders, which no sandbox that
 * would be worth having could permit anyway.

/* ===================== DASHBOARD TILE (PKGM00001) ===========================
   How the tiles that DO work on this console are actually built — read off the two homebrew
   tiles already installed (Elf Arsenal PSPS69691, Homebrew Launcher FAKE00000):

     * There is NO eboot and NO /system_ex/app/<TID> entry for either of them.
     * Each is a `deeplinkUri` tile: /user/appmeta/<TID>/param.json points at a LOCALHOST url
       (127.0.0.1:6969 and 127.0.0.1:8080), and tapping the tile opens that in the browser.
     * Registration is what creates /user/appmeta/<TID>; without it nothing appears.

   So ours points at 127.0.0.1:8710 — this very server. The tile then works with every PC on the
   network switched off, which the old build could not do: its eboot had a PC's LAN address baked
   in at compile time.

   Why it vanished: /user was wiped when the console was set up fresh, taking /user/app/PKGM00001
   and /user/appmeta/PKGM00001 with it, and boot-time registration had been removed on the
   assumption the tile was "already installed". It is installed here instead — but only when it is
   genuinely missing, which is what made the old boot-time version misbehave. */

   jb_escalate_pid() gives us the standard homebrew 0x4801000000000013.

   The swap is on OUR OWN process and is put back immediately; jb_escalate_pid already writes this
   exact field at boot with the same kernel primitive, so this is not a new class of operation. It
   is restored even when the install call fails, because leaving the process on a borrowed authid
   would change how every later request behaves. */
/* MEASURED 2026-08-25, and this is why the block below exists.

   Same package, same URI string, same console, the same second:
       ours    sceAppInstUtilInstallByPackage -> 0x80B2116F
       etaHEN  the identical call             -> SUCCESS
   Identical bytes in, different result out. The ARGUMENTS are eliminated; the difference is a
   property of the calling PROCESS.

   Diffing our process against etaHEN's util daemon (/api/engine/procdiff) leaves exactly four:

       field     ours                    etaHEN util (succeeds)
       authid    0x4801000000000013      0x4800000000000006     <- already A/B'd, no effect

       gid       0                       1

       attrs     (identical)             (identical)            <- eliminated

   jaildir is the striking one: jb_escalate_pid() sets rootdir AND jaildir to the root vnode,
   while etaHEN sets only rootdir and leaves jaildir NULL. A non-NULL jaildir means the process
   sits inside a jail. And our caps are a blunt memset(0xff) - "every bit set" is not the same as
   "maximum privilege", and a bit that should be zero is a plausible thing for ShellCore to check
   when it builds an APP actor and not when it builds an add-on actor.

   Everything here is applied to OUR OWN process for the duration of one call and restored on
   every exit path. Defaults leave behaviour exactly as before. */

/* ================ THE MASTER CODE ("Must Be On") ==============================================
 *
 * Some trainers are built in two pieces: a master block that installs a shared routine and the
 * scratch it works through, and then cheats that are diffs against it. Both formats we read carry
 * one, and the engine read neither - mods are found only inside the "mods" array.
 *
 *   json   "master": { "challenged": "yes", "memory": [ {offset, on}, ... ] }
 *   shn    <StartUP Text="Master Code 1 (Must Be On)"> <Cheatline>...</Cheatline> </StartUP>
 *
 * MEASURED, on the file we ship for Dark Souls II (CUSA01589 01.02) and on the running game. Its
 * "1 hit kill" installs a cave that does `cmp r15, [rip-0x2473876]` from +0x207786F, and the master's
 * cave does `mov [rip-0x2473807], rbx` from +0x2077807. Both resolve to the same qword: base -
 * 0x3FC000, absolute 0x4000 - which the agent reports as NOT inside any module this process has
 * loaded. So the slot the whole trainer works through does not exist, the game faults the first time
 * either routine runs, and that is both of the crashes the owner saw: on hitting an enemy (the damage
 * path) and instantly (the master's hook, which is in a path that runs constantly).
 *
 * The master is applied anyway when it CAN be - 17 of the 20 files carry no such operand - because a
 * cave-resident cheat cannot work without it. run_unreachable() is what separates the two cases.
 *
 * Applied whole or not at all, through the same gate a mod uses, and skipped entry by entry when it
 * is already in place - so the second cheat in a session costs four reads and no writes.

/* ---- WHAT A RUN OF CODE REACHES --------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * A cheat that installs a routine brings its own code, and that code can touch memory the game does
 * not have. Dark Souls II's master does `mov [rip-0x2473807], rbx` from image offset +0x2077807,
 * which is image base - 0x3FC000, i.e. absolute 0x4000 on these consoles - not inside any module the
 * process has loaded. The game faults the first time that path runs, which is exactly the crash the
 * owner reported for "1 hit kill" (on hitting an enemy) and then for the master itself (instantly).
 *
 * So before writing a run, resolve the RIP-relative operands in it and refuse if any of them points
 * somewhere we cannot even read.
 *
 * THE DECODE IS NARROW ON PURPOSE. It is not a disassembler: it looks for the exact prefixes that
 * appear in real cheat files and reads the disp32 that follows. Measured over the whole shipped
 * library - 8,126 cave mods and 20 master blocks - it finds 265 operands, 260 of which resolve to a
 * non-negative image offset and five of which resolve to exactly -0x3FC000, in three files. Five
 * identical values is the authoring tool's convention, not decoder noise. A false positive here
 * refuses a cheat that might have worked; a false negative crashes a game. */

       the NUL terminator is written as well. Five of five cases agree.
