/* PKG MUTANT SHOP - the PS4 home-screen app.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. The icon on the PS4's home screen, and the PS4 twin of the PS5's dashboard tile.
 * Pressing it gets the shop running on this console and then opens it in the console's own browser.
 * The shop is a web app: the ELF hosts the page and the API on port 8710 from inside the console,
 * so it works with every PC switched off.
 *
 * WHY THE PS5 TILE IS SMALLER THAN THIS. On the PS5 a package can be metadata only: its param.json
 * carries `deeplinkUri` and the system opens that URL when the icon is pressed - no program at all.
 * The PS4 has no such field. A PS4 icon is a real application with a real eboot, so this program
 * exists to do by hand what the PS5 gets from one line of metadata.
 *
 * NOTHING IS LINKED THAT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE. This links libkernel alone and resolves everything
 * else at run time, which is the shape of the toolchain's own hello_world - the one sample known to
 * launch on this console family.
 *
 * CE-32930-7 WAS NEVER THIS FILE'S FAULT, AND IT IS NOW SOLVED ELSEWHERE.
 *
 * The console refused to start this app because BGFT had no *task* for the title:
 *
 *     [BGFT] ERROR: [3568] task not found. (PKGM00001)
 *     sceBgftNotifyGameWillStart() ret = 80990019
 *
 * The package's PFS images mounted fine; ShellCore unmounted them and gave up. The real cause was
 * ps4-app/onconsole/server_ps4.c handing its finished BGFT task back after every install - see
 * bgft_sweep_ours() there. With one task left registered, this app launches and runs.
 *
 * TWO EXPLANATIONS BLAMING THIS FILE WERE BOTH WRONG - first the SCE_NEEDED_MODULE list, then
 * narrowing the link line to libkernel alone. Do not add a third. If the icon ever stops opening
 * again, look at the BGFT task table before looking here.
 *
 * WHAT IS ACTUALLY WRONG IN HERE, measured on the first successful launch:
 *   - sceKernelLoadStartModule("/system/common/lib/...") fails for every library, because inside an
 *     application sandbox they are mapped at /vm2LJNGVpN/common/lib/. So browser, user_init and
 *     notify all resolved to 0 and the direct browser call was dead.
 *   - Asking the payload instead (GET /api/open) worked first time. The payload is not sandboxed.
 *     That fallback is the only reason anything reached the television.
 *   - Returning from main() raises SIGSYS - a system call this sandbox does not permit, from the
 *     toolchain's own exit path. That is ONE of the two ways out of here that ends in an error
 *     dialog, and the _Exit override below removes it.
 *   - THE OTHER ONE, and the one measured to be firing now, is the exit itself:
 *     sceSystemServiceLoadExec("exit", NULL) has the system kill this process and then FAIL to
 *     spawn the exit helper (0x80aa001a). See the long note above leave(). Do not read the SIGSYS
 *     paragraph as the explanation for a CE-34878-0 seen today without checking klog first - the
 *     same code on the television has had two different causes.

/* A WRITE TO A SOCKET THE OTHER END HAS CLOSED KILLS THIS PROCESS, and that is very probably the
 * black screen followed by CE-34878-0.
 *
 * SIGPIPE's default action is to terminate. Every byte of the payload - 1.7 MB of it - goes out
 * through write() on a socket owned by the jailbreak's payload loader, and the moment that loader
 * decides it has enough (it saves the body to a temp file and then goes off to find and patch the
 * process it injects into) our next write lands on a closed pipe and this program is gone. No
 * message, no log line, no chance to notify: the signal is delivered and the process ends.
 *
 * The symptom matches exactly. The console showed the loader's own "payload received" notice - it
 * had the bytes - and then nothing at all, because the program that was supposed to wait for the
 * shop and open the browser had already been killed. And it is a race, which is why the same
 * build launched perfectly one day and died the next: the timing depends on what the console is
 * doing, and a reboot changes that.
 *
 * TWO LAYERS, because one of them may be refused:
 *   1. SIG_IGN for SIGPIPE, process-wide, before any socket exists. write() then returns -1/EPIPE,
 *      which every write_all() in here already handles as a failure.
 *   2. SO_NOSIGPIPE on each socket. FreeBSD's per-socket form of the same thing, and the PS4's
 *      network stack is FreeBSD. Defined here because the toolchain's headers may not carry it;
 *      the value is the FreeBSD one, and a kernel that does not know the option simply refuses
 *      the setsockopt, which is why its return value is deliberately not checked.
 *
 * This project has been bitten by SIGPIPE on this console before, in the payload. The payload
 * ignores it. This program - which does the single largest write anything here performs - did not.

/* ------------------------------------------------- calling things, and leaving without crashing
 *
 * NOTHING IS RESOLVED AT RUN TIME ANY MORE, because run-time resolution by absolute path cannot
 * work from inside an application sandbox and the first successful launch proved it:
 *
 *     [PMS] load /system/common/lib/libSceSystemService.sprx -> handle=-2147352574 res=0x00000000
 *     [PMS] resolved: browser=0 user_init=0 notify=0
 *
 * -2147352574 is 0x80020002, ORBIS_KERNEL_ERROR_ENOENT. The crash dump named the real location:
 * this process had its system libraries mapped at /vm2LJNGVpN/common/lib/ - a per-sandbox random
 * prefix - so /system/common/lib is simply not a path an application can see. Linking is how a
 * sandboxed app reaches these functions; the loader then resolves them from wherever the sandbox
 * actually keeps them.
 *
 * sceKernelSendNotificationRequest never needed any of that: it is a libkernel export declared in
 * orbis/libkernel.h, and -lkernel was on the link line the whole time. It was being looked up
 * through a handle that could never open.
 *
 * THE BROWSER CALL IS GONE. The toolchain declares `void sceSystemServiceLaunchWebBrowser();` -
 * no url, no return - so the four-argument call this file used to make was a guess dressed up with
 * a comment. Asking the shop's payload instead is measured working on this console (`/api/open`
 * answered 200 and the browser came forward), and the payload is not sandboxed. One route that
 * works beats two where one is invented.

/* ---- WHY THIS APP USED TO CRASH ON THE WAY OUT, and the two things that stop it
 *
 * The television showed an error to dismiss (CE-34878-0) every time, AFTER the shop had already
 * opened. This was ONE of its two causes and it is fixed; the other is the exit spawn, and the
 * note above leave() has that one with its own klog. klog for THIS one:
 *
 *     # A user thread receives a fatal signal
 *     # signal: 12 (SIGSYS)   thread name: eboot.bin
 *     # rip: 00000008000028bc   BrF: 0000000000406c20   BrT: 00000008000028b0
 *
 * SIGSYS is a system call this process is not allowed to make. The two branch registers say where
 * from: BrF 0x406c20 is in this eboot's own text (the PLT), BrT 0x8000028b0 is in libkernel, and
 * the fault is twelve bytes further in. That is the chain `return` out of main -> the CRT's exit ->
 * _Exit -> _exit@plt -> libkernel's _exit -> its syscall, refused. An application sandbox does not
 * get to call it.
 *
 * TWO LAYERS, and the first is what actually guarantees it:
 *
 *   1. DEFINE _Exit HERE. The toolchain's libc keeps _Exit, exit and _exit in three separate
 *      archive members (verified: `ar t libc.a` lists _Exit.lo, exit.lo, _exit.lo), so our
 *      definition satisfies exit's reference to _Exit and _exit.lo is never pulled in at all. The
 *      faulting instruction is not merely unreached, it is not in the binary. No stray exit(),
 *      abort() or `return` from main can find it again.
 *   2. LEAVE THE WAY AN APPLICATION IS MEANT TO. sceSystemServiceLoadExec("exit", NULL) is the
 *      documented way for a title to close itself and hand the user back to the system.
 *
 * If LoadExec is refused this parks instead of exiting. Parking is not lovely - the app sits
 * suspended and shows nothing if you navigate back to it, and it has to be closed with the PS
 * button - but it is quiet, and a silent oddity beats an error dialog after every single launch.
 * The return code is logged so the next person knows which of the two actually happened. */

/* ---- CE-34878-0 IS THE EXIT, AND NOW IT IS MEASURED RATHER THAN REASONED ABOUT
 *
 * klog, captured on a real press of the icon (2026-09-23), immediately after the shop answered
 * /api/open and the browser came forward - so the app had already done its whole job:
 *
 *     [Syscore App] Kill for LoadExec(0x6c)
 *     [Syscore App] Kill for LoadExec(0x6c) => 0
 *     [AppMgr Trace]: pid=0x6c, deleted.
 *     [AppMgr] Executing next spawn
 *     [Syscore App] processParam: elfPath = exit, fullPath = .../PKGM00001-app0-patch0-union/eboot.bin
 *     [Syscore App] processSpawn() error: 0x80aa001a
 *     [AppMgr] Exit spawn failed : 0x80aa001a  ELF path=exit
 *
 * So `sceSystemServiceLoadExec("exit", NULL)` does not fail politely and return a code we can act
 * on. The system KILLS this process first and only then fails to spawn the exit helper - which is
 * the error on the television. Both of the fallbacks written below it were therefore dead code:
 * neither the printf nor park_forever() can run, because by then there is no process left.
 *
 * WHAT IS BEING TRIED, AND WHY IT IS NOT A GUESSED SIGNATURE. The toolchain's own
 * include/orbis/SystemService.h declares `void sceSystemServiceKillLocalProcess();` - no
 * arguments, nothing to get wrong, and it says in its name exactly what is wanted here: end THIS
 * process, without asking AppMgr to spawn anything in its place.
 *
 * The risk is bounded in a way that matters on this project. This runs in an APPLICATION SANDBOX,
 * not in the shared host process the shop's payload lives in - so the worst case is this app
 * closing badly, which is already what happens every single time. It also runs last, after the
 * browser is on screen, so nothing the owner is waiting for depends on it.
 *
 * LoadExec stays as the second attempt: it is what a title is documented to use, and if a future
 * firmware makes the exit spawn work it is still the right call. Parking stays third. If the icon
 * ever starts leaving a suspended black app behind instead of an error dialog, this order is where
 * to look - park is quiet but it is not an exit. */
