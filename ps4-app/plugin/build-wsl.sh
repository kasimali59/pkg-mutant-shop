#
# WHY THIS IS NOT GoldHEN's MAKEFILE. Its plugin Makefile links $(GOLDHEN_SDK)/build/crtprx.o and
# -lGoldHEN_Hook. We need neither: the hook library is for patching other people's functions, which
# this agent deliberately does not do, and OpenOrbis ships its own library startup object
# (lib/crtlib.o) for exactly this shape of output. That matters beyond tidiness - the GoldHEN SDK
# repository would not clone on this machine (git timed out twice), and a build that depends on it
# is a build nobody can reproduce here. Everything below comes out of the OpenOrbis toolchain that
# is checked out locally, plus the ONE fact that had to come from GoldHEN: how its loader finds a
# plugin, which is dlsym("plugin_load") - and that was read off the console's own plugin_loader.prx.
#
# The link line, the --paid value and the create-fself --lib form are GoldHEN's, read from
# plugin_src/plugin_template/Makefile in its plugins repository (which did clone). They are copied
# rather than invented because a PRX the loader will not accept fails silently.

# OUR OWN crt, not OpenOrbis's crtlib.o. See source/crt_prx.c for the full why: crtlib.o is the
# startup for a standalone homebrew ELF and runs the whole C runtime at load AND stamps the module
# with SDK 0x1000051; a plugin the loader maps into a running game must do nothing at load and carry
# the SDK version the working plugins on this firmware carry (0x4508101). Building our plugin with
# crtlib.o was the difference between it and GoldHEN's plugins that load cleanly, and load-time is
# where the game froze. Our crt is trivial: the right sce_module_param, and _init -> module_start
# (which returns 0). Nothing of ours runs until the loader calls plugin_load.

# -e _init is load-bearing: a PRX is entered through _init, not main, and without it the module
# starts at the wrong place and the loader reports success while nothing runs.
#
# --pack-dyn-relocs=none: CHEAP INSURANCE, AND NOT THE CAUSE. Written down honestly because the
# first version of this note claimed it WAS the cause, and that was wrong.
#
# A dump of our DYNAMIC table appeared to show an extra leading entry, tag 0x24 (DT_RELR, the
# compact relative-relocation format lld 18 emits by default) that neither working plugin had. It
# was a MISREAD: the 16 bytes before the table are the tail of a preceding array of consecutive
# indices, and a scanner looking for "plausible tags" swallowed them. Both tables really begin at
# tag 0x61000025 and both hold 37 identical entries in the same order. There is no DT_RELR in our
# module and there never was. Verify the instrument before believing the bug.
#
# The flag stays only because it costs nothing and guarantees this old loader is never handed a
# relocation format it predates. It changed nothing and it fixed nothing.
#
# EXPORT EXACTLY WHAT THE LOADER LOOKS UP - not every symbol in the module.
#
# A blanket --export-dynamic is what we used to pass, and it is a real, measured difference from
# every plugin this console loads cleanly: those are built WITHOUT it. It exports every
# default-visibility symbol - all of our own functions plus everything libc-facing - and our export
# data came out noticeably larger than the template's for a module of similar size. A loader
# walking a far longer export table than any plugin it was written against is a plausible way to
# break a load, and it is the last real deviation left now that the crt, the paid, the SDK version,
# the segment set and the DYNAMIC table have all been matched.
#
# module_start / module_stop are NOT in that list, and putting them there was a mistake worth
# recording: both are declared attr_module_hidden (weak + hidden visibility), exactly as the
# working plugins declare them, and the loader never looks them up - our crt calls module_start
# directly. Asking the linker to export a symbol that is deliberately hidden is contradictory, and
# a module that crashes games at load is not where you keep a contradiction.
#
# Naming the remaining symbols keeps plugin_load findable - removing the flag entirely leaves it
# unexported, which the build check below catches - while producing a table the size a plugin is
# supposed to have.
#
# The original note, kept because it is why a blanket flag was there at all: GoldHEN's own
# plugin Makefile does not pass it, so it was removed to match that proven recipe exactly - and the
# module check immediately refused the build: without it our plugin_load is not exported at all,
# the name is not even in the file. Their plugins get the export some other way (their SDK lib or
# crt keeps the symbols alive); ours needs the flag. Removing it fails SAFE - a plugin the loader
# cannot find does nothing - but it is also a useless plugin, so the flag stays.
#
# Measured while chasing a plugin that breaks games, which is why this note is long: THE BUILD
# RECIPE IS NOT THE DIFFERENCE. Their CFLAGS are identical to ours (same freebsd12 target, same
# -fPIC -funwind-tables -isysroot), the --paid is the same, the crt is now equivalent, and the
# module we produce matches a working one on segment set and DYNAMIC size. Look elsewhere.
#
# The original note, kept because it is why the flag was added:
# --export-dynamic was load-bearing, and it cost a build to find. Nothing inside this module
# references plugin_load - the only caller is the plugin loader, from outside, by dlsym - so the
# linker had every reason to leave it out of the dynamic table, and it did: the first build
# produced a clean .prx whose dynamic symbol table was EMPTY. visibility("default") is not enough
# on its own for a -pie link; it says "may be exported", not "export it". A plugin like that loads
# without complaint and then does nothing at all, which on a console is indistinguishable from
# never having been listed in plugins.ini.
