/* PKG MUTANT SHOP - the PS4 on-console payload.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. The PS5 half of this app is ps5-app/onconsole/server.c: a payload that serves the
 * shop's web UI and a JSON API on :8710 and installs packages. This is the same idea for a
 * jailbroken PS4 (FW 13.52, GoldHEN). It is a SEPARATE BINARY - a PS5 prospero ELF simply does not
 * run on a PS4 (measured: GoldHEN accepts it, reports "launched successfully", and nothing
 * happens) - but it deliberately speaks THE SAME HTTP API, so the one web UI and the one PC
 * companion drive either console without caring which is on the other end.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A SEPARATE FILE RATHER THAN #ifdefs IN server.c. The PS5 file is shipping, dense, and
 * full of hard-won facts whose comments record what each arrangement cost to learn. Interleaving a
 * second console's kernel work into it is how you break a working app. Nothing here touches it.
 * The one piece borrowed is the SQLite reader, copied verbatim into sqmini.h (see that file).
 *
 * WHAT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE PS5, AND WHY:
 *
 *   Install. The PS5 lane spawns a helper process that calls sceAppInstUtilInstallByPackage,
 *   because on PS5 that call fails from an injected payload. That function DOES NOT EXIST on PS4.
 *   The PS4 route is BGFT: register a download task pointing at the companion's HTTP URL and start
 *   it; the console downloads and installs it itself, with its own progress and its own toasts.
 *   That is the same shape as the PS5 lane from the companion's side - we serve the bytes, the
 *   console pulls them - which is why the API can stay the same. See bgft.h for where every
 *   signature came from; none of it is guessed.
 *
 *   No kernel read/write. GoldHEN injects us into a process it has already jailbroken, so we start
 *   as root - but it provides no kexec syscall, so the SDK's kernel helpers are unavailable (see
 *   sdk-goldhen.patch.py). Everything here is ordinary userland: sockets, libc, and sce* calls.
 *   The consequence is that the cheat/patch engine, which writes another process's memory through
 *   a page-table walk, has NO PS4 equivalent yet and is not pretended at: the routes answer a
 *   plain "not available on this console" rather than silently doing nothing.
 *
 *   No backups/mount lane. A PS4 game is a PKG. There is no ShadowMount, no .ffpfsc, and no
 *   "runs in place from a drive" concept, so none of that exists here.
 *
 * WHAT IT SHARES WITH THE PS5 BUILD: the web UI (same web/ bundle, same generator), the API route
 * names, the file API so the companion can move files over HTTP instead of FTP, the app.db-derived
 * library, the icon server, and the notification style.

 * WHY THIS LANE EXISTS. Every install this shop has ever started on a PS4 went through BGFT, and

 *
 * HOLD THE OUTCOME TO THE SAME PROOF AS EVERYTHING ELSE. The PS5 half of this project has a hard-won
 * warning about the same-named call: there, AppInstallPkg registers metadata and installs no game
 * data, answering ok while nothing arrives. Whether that is also true on a PS4 is NOT known, so this

 * PS4 where no FTP had ever been loaded. FTP is not ours: it is GoldHEN's, and it is up only if the

 * 1337, where the other PS4 FTP payloads listen. The PC companion already tries that pair in that
 * order (FTP_FALLBACKS in companion/server.py), so this asks rather than deciding for the user.
 *
 * MEMOISED FOR A MOMENT, because the page asks three of these routes the one question inside a
 * single refresh. The window is far shorter than the 6 s poll, so an FTP the owner has just loaded
 * still lights up on the next tick. The probe runs OUTSIDE the lock: a connect is bounded by the
 * kernel's retries rather than by the timeouts set above, and holding the lock across it would
 * queue every other request thread behind whoever happened to be probing. A thread arriving while a

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------- claiming the slot
 *
 * THE BUSY CHECK WAS CHECK-THEN-ACT, AND THE GAP WAS A WHOLE BGFT REGISTRATION WIDE.
 *
 * Every route that starts a transfer read `active` under the lock, RELEASED the lock, called
 * bgft_install_url() - which registers a task with the console and starts it - and only then took
 * the lock again to fill the slot in. Two requests arriving inside that gap both read "not busy",
 * both registered a task, and the second overwrote the slot: the first task went on downloading
 * with nothing following it, while progress, the finished check and the cancel button all described
 * the second package. That is the exact failure the busy check was added to prevent - it narrowed
 * the window instead of closing it. Five routes had the shape: install_local_pkg,
 * /api/engine/install-spawn, /api/queue/start, a row's /retry, and POST /api/install. (The
 * mode:"queued" branch never did: it tests and fills under one lock hold, which is the pattern
 * this brings to the rest.)
 *
 * The test and the claim happen under ONE lock hold now, and the registration runs against a slot
 * that is already marked taken. Between the claim and the commit the slot is active while
 * task is still BGFT_INVALID_TASK_ID, and g_job_claim holds that claim's token.
 *
 * WHY NOTHING ASKS BGFT ABOUT THAT SLOT. What the service does when handed a task id it never
 * issued is not written down in bgft.h, in any header this builds against, or anywhere in this
 * repo - and this payload runs as root inside a shared system daemon, where finding out by trying
 * is how you take the console down with you. The file already encodes the answer as a convention:
 * bgft_release() returns early on BGFT_INVALID_TASK_ID rather than passing it on. Everything that
 * could otherwise reach the service during a claim now follows that same convention - job_refresh()
 * skips its poll, the stranded-task sweeper does not run, and the two cancel routes guard the stop
 * call they were making unguarded. No invalid id is handed to BGFT, so what it would do with one
 * stays unknown and stays irrelevant.

   the slot free, so a SECOND install can claim it before the first returns from bgft_install_url.
   The first would then find the boolean set again, believe the claim was still its own, and write

 * the other side: typed, but three of its four integers have no documented meaning, so there would
 * be no honest way to close what we had opened.
 *

 * cheat chain - a cheat actually landing in a running game - is verified by somebody starting a
 * game, and nothing here can stand in for that.

/* ------------------------------------------------- not leaving tasks behind
 *
 * BGFT keeps one directory per registered task under /user/bgft/task and that table is NOT
 * unlimited. After a handful of test installs on this console every new register started coming
 * back 0x80990086 while the directories of those dead tasks were still sitting there - which was
 * read as a full table and is not (see bgft_sweep_ours): a task only
 * disappears when somebody unregisters it, so a shop that does not clean up after itself ends up
 * unable to install anything at all - including the packages it installed fine an hour earlier.
 *
 * Two halves, because one is not enough on its own:
 *   - going forward, a job that reaches a terminal state releases its own task (bgft_release);
 *   - for anything already stranded, we sweep. A payload reload loses the ids we were holding, and
 *     an install interrupted by a crash or a power cut leaves a task nobody remembers, so the ids
 *     have to be recovered from the console rather than from memory.
 *
 * WHICH TASKS ARE OURS. BGFT writes the task record as plain text inside d0.pdb, download url and
 * all. Every install we start is plain http on one of two routes we own - /library/ on a companion,
 * or /pkgfile/ on this console itself - and a real PlayStation Store task is https on a Sony host.
 * Both halves must match before we touch anything, so the tasks this PS4 already had from the
 * user's own store downloads are left exactly as they are. Requiring http alone would not be
 * enough: this console's own firmware-update task is plain http too, and carries neither route.
 *
 * BOTH ROUTES, NOT JUST /library/. The first version of this matched only the companion route, so a
 * task left behind by an install from the console's own storage was invisible to the sweep and sat
 * in the table forever - the exact leak this function exists to clear.
 *
 * We never sweep the job we are currently following either; the install route refuses to start a
 * second job while one is live, so at sweep time ours is the only one that can be running.

 * BGFT answered `[BGFT] ERROR: [3568] task not found. (PKGM00001)`, that call returned 0x80990019,

 * CE-32930-7 on screen. Leaving one task registered for the title and pressing again:
 *
 *     [BGFT] [606] GameWillStart(PKGM00001, 2) start
 *     [BGFT] [576] task(00000075) PKGM00001            <- found instead of "task not found"

 *
 * The rule: a task whose title actually has an app.pkg on disk is KEPT - that is its launch ticket.
 * Only tasks whose title installed nothing (failed, abandoned, orphaned by a payload reload) are
 * released here, because those are pure waste.
 *
 * WHAT DOES NOT HAPPEN HERE IS RECLAIMING UNDER "TABLE PRESSURE", because there is no measured
 * table pressure. This project believed for a long time that `/user/bgft/task` had about twelve
 * slots and that 0x80990086 meant it was full. klog says otherwise, in words:

 *
 * printed for the very register that answered 0x80990086. The conflict is PER CONTENT ID, not a
 * global count - which is also why releasing tasks always appeared to "make room": the task being
 * released was the one holding that content id. Measured since: registering worked fine with
 * thirteen directories in the table. So nothing is given up to make room, and no title loses its

           A console that can reach PlayStation Network checks every title for an update before it

           it cannot fetch it - the package came from here, not from the store - so it abandons the
           whole thing with nothing written.

           0x80990004 IS THAT CASE, and it is measured twice on this console rather than guessed.
           The second time the console spelled the sequence out in klog:

               [ScePatchChecker] check (title_id='CUSA14409', app_version='01.00'): status=1

           status=1 is PlayStation Network saying a newer version exists. The first time, the only
           fingerprint we had was arithmetic - BGFT asked for 238,419,968 bytes against a
           227,540,992-byte package, the difference being the update - and that test is kept because
           it catches the case where the code differs.

           It still has to be paired with "nothing landed on disk": a code on its own is not a
           diagnosis, and this project has twice shipped a confident wrong one. Anything else gets

 * walks /mnt/usb0..7 three levels deep and every package it finds is a row in /api/library - so a
 * delete that reached them would be deleting the library this shop exists to serve. The PS5's
 * delete lane learned the same lesson from the other end: a drive root is not a folder that exists
 * to hold our things, and treating it as one hands the owner's own files the rules that were
 * written for a scan folder.
 *
 * Nothing on this console needs more than this. The only caller that has ever had to remove a file
 * here is the deploy and cleanup probe the tools write into the shop's own folder and then ask us
 * to take away again.
 *
 * The folder itself is not deletable either way it is spelt: the root is compared WITH its
 * trailing slash and something has to follow that slash, so neither /data/pkg-mutant-shop nor
 * /data/pkg-mutant-shop/ passes and only a path INSIDE it does. Reads and listings stay unbounded,
 * exactly as on the PS5 - the whole point of them is the console's own databases - but an

 * listening socket - 47,000 consecutive failures, the port still open, every request answered by a
 * reset. A kernel that cannot allocate a socket cannot accept one.

 *
 * "Installed" is app.pkg on disk with bytes in it, never an app.db row on its own - the rule this
 * project learned on the PS5, where trusting the row produced 53 phantom installs. The version
 * comes from tbl_appinfo's APP_VER, which is the field the console itself updates when a package
 * is installed over another.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the jailbreak's folders or files. The staged copy lives under our own

     * newer version BEFORE it downloads: when it finds one it builds a two-part task, fetches our
     * package, cannot fetch the update, and abandons the whole thing. Measured on this console -
     * Bluey's Quest for the Gold Pen, a 737,869,824-byte package, BGFT asked for 1,348,665,344 and
     * gave up at 89%; Castle Crashers Remastered the same at 2%. Riptide GP2 installed first time
     * because the Store has no newer version of it. That is the difference, and it is not ours.
     *
     * klog shows the console finishing an install with two calls of its own, AFTER the download:
     *     begin AppPrePromotePkgExt(/user/bgft/task/<id>/app.pkg)
     *     begin sceAppInstaller::AppInstallApp(/user/bgft/task/<id>, 0)
     * If those are reachable from here, a package already on this console could be installed
     * directly - no BGFT, no download, and no patch check to fail. This route answers only whether
     * the symbols exist. It resolves names and reports addresses; it calls nothing. Guessing a
     * signature and calling it is how this project once crashed a console, so the calling comes
     * later, from the answer, not from a hunch. */

           This ELF tries to replace it and the download service refuses a package the console
           serves to itself (0x80991404, PlayStation Network being blocked - which is the
           configuration the shop asks for), and the direct lane cannot make a launch ticket, so
           replacing a working icon with it would be a downgrade. The PC has no such problem: the
           download service takes a package served from the PC. So the honest thing this end can

 * a shared system daemon, and it sends "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *" on its JSON. Without a
 * guard, ANY page the console's own browser happens to open - an ad frame on a game-wiki, a
 * shortened link, anything - can fire a state-changing GET at 127.0.0.1:8710 and READ the reply.
 * Not theoretical on this console: /api/quit takes the shop down, /api/notify puts arbitrary text
 * on the television, /api/engine/install-spawn takes a package URL of the caller's choosing, and
 * POST /api/fs/write writes any absolute path. The owner browses on this machine; that is the
 * whole point of the app.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. A request with no Origin and no Referer is allowed: that is curl, the
 * companion, our own tools, and the console's own download service fetching /pkgfile/. The test is
 * only ever "if a page names itself, is that page from a private address".

       stops returning. :8710 then never opens, so there is no shop, no health, no UI and no way
       to see what happened - from outside it is indistinguishable from a payload that never ran.

       The install engine is not needed to LISTEN. It is needed to install, and every install
       route already refuses when g_bgft_ready is false. So it moves to startup_extras() with the
       rest of the optional work, after the socket is up. A console whose install engine is wedged
       now still serves its library, its settings and its cheats, and says engine_ready:false -
