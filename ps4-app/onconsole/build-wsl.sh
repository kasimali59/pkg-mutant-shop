# Build the PS4 on-console payload (the PS4 half of PKG MUTANT SHOP).
#
# This is the sibling of ps5-app/onconsole/build-wsl.sh and deliberately runs THE SAME GATES: the
# two payloads share one web UI, and a UI that will not parse, a language missing a key, or a
# message off house style must stop both builds, not just one. It does NOT touch the PS5 tree.
#
# One-time setup this performs by itself if needed: clone the ps4-payload-dev SDK and apply
# sdk-goldhen.patch.py to it. That patch is what makes a payload actually RUN under GoldHEN - see
# the comments in the patch for exactly why, and never skip it.
#
# TWO BUILDS COME OUT OF THIS FILE:
#   (default)  the full payload - carries the home-screen app's package and installs it
#   --lite     the same shop with NO package inside, which is the copy that travels INSIDE that
#              package so pressing the icon can start the shop
# That is how the cycle is broken. ps4-app/build-all-wsl.sh builds them in the only order that
# works; running this on its own builds the full one and needs the package to exist already.
#
# Usage (WSL):  bash build-wsl.sh [--lite] [PORT]
