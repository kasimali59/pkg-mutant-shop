"""Keep ps4-app/onconsole/sqmini.h honest against its source in ps5-app/onconsole/server.c.

The PS4 payload needs the same read-only SQLite scan the PS5 payload uses. That block is pure
format work with no platform in it, but the PS5 file is shipping and is not going to be edited to
share it - the risk is all downside. So it is COPIED, and this script is what stops a copy from
quietly rotting: it re-extracts the block and compares.

    python tools/ps4_sync_sqmini.py            # update the copy from server.c
    python tools/ps4_sync_sqmini.py --check    # exit 1 if it has drifted (used by the PS4 build)
