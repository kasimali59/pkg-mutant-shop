"""One command that answers "is everything actually working?" - PC first, then the console.

Written after a session where the same facts were re-established five times by hand. Everything it
checks was a real bug at some point; each check names the thing it is guarding against.

    python tools/ready_check.py                 # wait for the console, then check everything
    python tools/ready_check.py --offline       # only what can be checked with no PS5
    python tools/ready_check.py --wait 600      # how long to wait for the console (default 180s)
    python tools/ready_check.py --route         # ALSO run the transfer test (copies a real
                                                # package to the drive you pick; off by default)
    python tools/ready_check.py --test-delete   # ALSO prove our file API writes and deletes for
                                                # real, in the shop's own folder - never in a

It never installs a PKG and never deletes one of your games: the delete lane is exercised with
a title id no console can carry (PMSX99999) and must answer "nothing to delete". Nothing it
writes goes into a ShadowMount watch folder (/data/homebrew, /mnt/*/homebrew) under a final name.

The console address comes from --ip, else from the config the exe actually uses (Desktop, then
companion/dist, then companion/config.json - see tools/verify_console.py). It never defaults to
a guessed address, and the console is never handed 127.0.0.1 as a source.
