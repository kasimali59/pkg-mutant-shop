"""Stamp the real version into every artifact that carries one, before anything is bundled.

The UI carried a hardcoded APP_VERSION used until /api/health answers, so every load
flashed whatever number was last typed there (1.1.1) before snapping to the true one.
Both artifacts bundle web/ directly, so stamping the file once covers the EXE and the ELF.

Single source of truth: companion/server.py VERSION. Stamped into:
    web/index.html                 var APP_VERSION="..."
    ps5-app/onconsole/server.c     #define SHOP_VERSION "..."
    ps5-app/homebrew.js            "version": "..."      (the launcher manifest sat at 0.5.0)

REFUSES if any target is missing or carries no stamp point. An earlier version silently skipped
server.c when it could not be read, and "stamped" then meant only the UI - which is how the
console reported 3.39.0 while the companion said 3.40.0.
