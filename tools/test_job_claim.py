"""Race the PS4's install slot on real hardware, and prove only one caller can take it.

WHAT THIS CATCHES. Every route that starts a transfer used to read "is an install running" under the
lock, RELEASE the lock, register a task with the console, and only then take the lock again to fill
the slot in. Two requests inside that gap both read "not busy", both registered, and the second
overwrote the slot - so the first task went on downloading with nothing following it, while
progress, the finished check and the cancel button all described the second package.

Measured on the owner's PS4 at 3.64.0, twelve concurrent presses of Start queue, in the console's
own install log:

    without the claim   12 x "install: register failed ... RACEPROBE"   in the same second
    with the claim       1 x

NOTHING IS INSTALLED BY THIS TEST. The url it queues has no .pkg extension, and BGFT reads the
extension out of the url and refuses such a task at REGISTRATION with 0x80990033 ("Not supported
extension") - measured, and recorded in server_ps4.c. So every attempt dies before a byte moves. No
console-owned task is touched: the only task this could ever create is one of ours, and it never
gets that far.

It also checks the three things that are easy to get wrong once a claim exists:
  * the losers are turned away rather than queued behind
  * the row is HELD again afterwards - the abort has to put back what it took
  * the slot is not left wedged, which would need the payload reloaded to clear
