"""Does the companion's DNS actually answer, and actually block PlayStation Network?

Runs companion/server.py from source with the PSN blocker on, then asks it real DNS questions the
way a console would: one Sony name that must come back NXDOMAIN, and one ordinary name that must be
forwarded and answered. Both matter equally - a blocker that breaks ordinary DNS is what turned the
console's browser into WV-33920-7 for every address.

companion/config.json is saved and restored. The shipped exe must be stopped first, because both
would want UDP 53 on the same address.
