"""Gate: the front page and the release notes say what the code says.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The README's badges were written by hand, so they drifted: the front page of a
public repository said **version 3.89.1** and **PS5 12.70** while the app was 3.92.1 and the
console it had just been fixed for was on 13.60. It is the first thing anyone sees, and it was
three releases and three firmwares out of date. The owner noticed before any gate did.

The release notes drifted the other way - into prose written at one person ("3.92.0 learned it and
kept it, but the console list did not pass it on") instead of a changelog anyone can skim - and
their Download table named the OWNER'S console firmware rather than the ceiling the build could
actually run on, which is the one thing a stranger downloading an ELF needs.

So: the badges are STAMPED by tools/stamp_version.py from companion/server.py, and this refuses a
release where any of it has come apart.
