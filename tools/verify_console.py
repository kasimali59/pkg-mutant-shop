"""End-to-end verification against a live PS5, in an order that ISOLATES VARIABLES.

WHY THE ORDER MATTERS
---------------------
On 2026-08-25 the console hard-crashed during an install and there was no way to tell which of
several changes did it, because everything had been exercised together. This runs the same ground
in stages, cheapest and safest first, and probes the console's health BETWEEN EVERY STAGE - so if
it dies, the stage number names the culprit.

The install stages are deliberately ordered to separate the open hypotheses:

    stage 4  install with NO display name      - reproduces the lane that is PROVEN good
    stage 5  install with a plain ASCII name   - adds only the name passthrough
    stage 6  install with a non-ASCII name     - adds only unusual bytes in MetaInfo.content_name
    stage 7  the same install driven by the PC companion - adds only the PC lane
    stage 8  /api/open (launches the console browser) - LAST, because it is a panic suspect and
             the least important feature in the app

Usage
    python tools/verify_console.py                 # stages 0-4: one install, the proven lane
    python tools/verify_console.py --stage 0-3     # read-only stages, no installs at all
    python tools/verify_console.py --all           # stages 0-8: the name-passthrough installs
                                                   # (5, 6), the PC-driven lane (7) and /api/open
    python tools/verify_console.py --all --force   # let stage 7 re-install over a registered title
    python tools/verify_console.py --ip 10.0.0.99 --title CUSA02365 --key Riptide-GP2-CUSA02365.pkg

ONE INSTALL BY DEFAULT. Stages 4-7 used to run back to back, and each hands the SAME package to
the console again as soon as the spawned installer's verdict says "accepted" - which is before
BGFT has finished downloading and registering it. Submitting a package on top of its own live
BGFT job is the shape of the 2026-08-25 panic. So 5-7 are opt-in (--all), and with --all the
tool reads bgft.db between install stages and waits for the title's newest row to settle before
spawning again.

WHERE THE CONSOLE ADDRESS COMES FROM (first hit wins):
    1. --ip
    2. ~\\Desktop\\PKG MUTANT SHOP\\config.json   - beside the exe the user actually runs
    3. companion/dist/config.json              - beside a freshly built exe
    4. companion/config.json                   - running from source
The exe reads the config.json beside itself, not the repo's; the two have held different console
addresses before, which is how the wrong machine gets measured (memory: a peer PC was adopted as
the console). Nothing here ever defaults to loopback or to a guessed address.

Nothing here writes to the console except the install stages, and every install is of a package
already in the library. Stage 3 is read-only unless the lane is STALE (latch set past the console's
own 600 s rule): a merely busy lane is left alone, because clearing it is what let a duplicate
install through.
