# Both artifacts embed web/index.html. build-wsl.sh runs tools/check_web.py and
# tools/stamp_version.py before it bundles the UI into the ELF; NOTHING ran them before the exe
# bundled it. So building only the exe could ship a UI whose script does not parse - which blanks
# the app on every device while the server keeps answering 200 - or a stale APP_VERSION that makes
# the page lie about which build the user is looking at.
#
# It happened to be safe until now only because the ELF was always built first by hand. Ordering is
# not a safeguard; this is.
