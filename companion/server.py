PKG MUTANT SHOP - companion server
============================================
Stdlib only (Python 3.8+; Pillow for card thumbnails). No pip installs, no CDNs, no external services.
The PC half of the app: serves the library over HTTP Range, the on-console ELF installs from it.

v0.4 adds: multi-console fleet + "send to all", parallel queue with per-console serialization,
unified REAL progress (local byte-count OR polling a remote companion's /api/served), SHA-256
integrity, per-title manifests.

Honest markers:  # REAL works now   # ON-DEVICE real code, console confirms it

    stop the payloads on a console that has none while telling the owner it was safe to rest the one
    that does. A PS5 woken from rest with its payloads still loaded panics.

    In order, stopping at the first that answers:

      1. THE CALLER NAMED ONE - `console` in the body, or ?console= in the query. An explicit name
         wins even when it is the "wrong" platform for the route: if someone points a PS5-only

    Not shipped and not required: OUR on-console ELF implements the whole cheat engine itself
    (Ps5Bridge.mutant_* and mods_action), and every mods route asks it first. This class is kept
    only as a last-resort fallback for someone who still runs CheatRunner beside the shop, and it
    is only ever consulted after our engine has said it has no cheat file for the title.
    alive() caches its answer both ways so a missing service costs nothing on the hot paths.

        This is the single setting that decides whether a PS5 backup becomes a working game or a
        tile that crashes, and it is worth stating plainly because it cost a long night to find.

        ShadowMount does two separate things: it MOUNTS the container, then it REGISTERS the title
        with the system. Mounting had always worked. Registering failed every time, with:

            [REG] internal AppInstallTitleDir bridge unavailable
            NOTIFY: Register failed: <game> (<TID>)

        That "internal bridge" is a patch ShadowMount writes into SceShellCore, and on this console
        it is never installed at all — its own startup log says why:

            [SHELLCORE] unexpected prologue: launchApp at 0x1563c660
            [SHELLCORE] lifecycle hooks unavailable; stock behavior kept

        So the direct per-title register route cannot work here. ShadowMount has a second route,
        and its own documentation says this firmware is supposed to be on it already:

            # 1/true/yes/on  -> submit queued installs through sceAppInstUtilAppInstallAll
            # 0/false/no/off -> register each title directly
            # Default: 0 on FW below 12.00, forced to 1 on FW 12.00 and newer

        The console is on 12.70 — but its runtime config dump read `app_install_all=0`, so the
        forcing does not happen in 1.7alpha4 and it used the broken route. Setting the key
        explicitly switched the very same file from "Register failed" to "[REG] Installed", with
        full `appmeta` (which is what gives the PS5 notification the real name and artwork instead
        of "Unknown"). No console restart was involved.

    #     the FTP this app itself uses to read app.db and bgft.db.
    #   * _arsenal_running() returned True on a console with no Arsenal, so every install ran the
    #     full Arsenal preflight: an FTP fetch of /data/elf-arsenal/config.ini plus two refused
    #     connects to :6969, measured at ~4.1 s of dead time per install.
    # The fight is over :12800. ftpsrv binds 2121, nanodns binds 53/udp, klogsrv binds neither -
    # none of them can ever be an install-port conflict, so removing them loses nothing.

    # NEVER add the bare "payload" here: Payload Manager names EVERY loaded payload payload.elf,
    # our own ELF included, and sweeping by that name has already killed this app once.
    # The Arsenal/conflict process lists lived here. They named elf-arsenal.elf, dpiv2.elf,
    # dpi.elf, tile-autoinst and garlic-savemgr so the app could stop them fighting over the
    # install port. This app has no install port to fight over and does not ship either payload,

# PSN blocker - a DNS server that answers everything except PlayStation        #
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
#
# WHY THIS IS IN A GAME INSTALLER AT ALL.
#
# A jailbroken PS4 that can reach PlayStation Network does two things that make it unusable as a
# homebrew console, and both were measured on the owner's machine rather than read about:
#
#   * IT REFUSES TO INSTALL. Before downloading anything the console asks PSN whether the title has
#     a newer version. When it finds one it builds a task with a second piece in it - the update -
#     fetches the package it was given, cannot fetch the update, and abandons the whole install.
#     Bluey's Quest for the Gold Pen: a 737,869,824-byte package, the console demanded 1,348,665,344,
#     and gave up at 89%. Castle Crashers Remastered: the same at 2%. Riptide GP2 installed first
#     time, because the Store has no newer version of it. That is the entire difference.
#   * IT DELETES WHAT IS ALREADY INSTALLED. After a restart, every fake-signed RETAIL title was gone
#     from /user/app, /user/appmeta and app.db - three of them - while the owner's own Store game and
#     our homebrew-prefixed app survived untouched.
#
# THE OBVIOUS FIX MAKES THINGS WORSE. Setting the console's DNS to 127.0.0.1 stops it reaching PSN
# and also stops it reaching everything else, including our own page on the LAN: the console's
# connection check fails and the browser then answers WV-33920-7 for every address, IP or not.
# A public "update blocker" DNS has the same shape of problem - it is someone else's server, it may
# be down, and it decides for you what is blocked.
#
# So the companion answers DNS itself. Sony's names get NXDOMAIN; everything else is forwarded to a
# real resolver and relayed back untouched. The console keeps working - browser, LAN, our page - and
# simply cannot find PlayStation Network. It also cannot find a system update, which is what the
# owner wanted anyway.
#
# It listens on the LAN address rather than 0.0.0.0 on purpose: Windows already has something on
# 0.0.0.0:53 (svchost) on this machine, and binding the specific address both coexists with it and
# keeps this off the loopback interface. A bind that fails is logged and the rest of the app carries
# on - a game installer must not refuse to start because a side feature could not open a port.

    # WHY THIS EXISTS. Both servers answer with Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * and neither has any
    # authentication - deliberately, because everything on a jailbroken console is open and
    # Payload Manager on :8084 will load an arbitrary kernel-privileged ELF for anyone who asks.
    # Hardening against someone already ON the LAN is therefore mostly theatre.
    #
    # What is NOT theatre is a page on the public internet. Any site the user visits, in any
    # browser on this network, can fire a cross-origin request at http://<this-pc>:8710/... and
    # our handlers would run it. That needs no LAN access and no knowledge of the user - just a
    # visit to a hostile page while the companion is running.
    #
    # The discriminator that works here is NOT "same origin" - the console serves the UI from
    # 10.0.0.99 and legitimately calls this PC cross-origin, which is the whole architecture. It
    # is whether the caller's origin is on the LAN AT ALL. A hostile public site has a DNS
    # hostname; every legitimate caller here is a private-range IP literal or loopback.
    #
    # Absent Origin AND Referer is allowed on purpose: that is curl, our own tooling, and
    # server-to-server calls, none of which a remote page can forge.
    #
    # But a browser CAN be made to send neither - a page with a no-referrer policy loading a
    # state-changing GET as an <img>, a <script> or a top-level navigation - and "Origin: null"
    # from a sandboxed frame is not a name either. So the browser's own statement of HOW the
    # request was made is consulted too: Sec-Fetch-Mode and Sec-Fetch-Dest cannot be set or
    # suppressed by a page. A navigation, a subresource load or a no-cors fetch is refused;
    # ABSENT headers stay allowed (curl, urllib, the console's own calls, older WebKit), and
    # everything the UI does is fetch() in mode "cors" or "same-origin" with an empty dest, so
    # nothing the app itself does changes. Mirrors sec_fetch_ok() in server.c.
    #
    # Private ranges: RFC 1918, loopback, link-local (169.254 - APIPA when DHCP fails) and the
    # CGNAT block 100.64/10 that Tailscale hands out - none of them routable from the internet,
    # so none can be a hostile page's origin. A name is accepted in exactly one case: when it is
    # this server's own Host header, which makes the page first-party by definition - browsing
    # the PC as http://asus-lap:8710 used to 403 every button while the page loaded fine.

#
# The console keeps that address. The suite then exits, 8791 dies, and the console goes on handing
# the page a PC that is not there: measured on the owner's PS5, which was still offering
# http://10.0.0.76:8791 long after the test that put it there had gone. The page only notices when
# the real PC is briefly unavailable - during a rebuild, say - and then walks its candidate list
# into the dead one, which is exactly what the owner saw in the console's browser.
#
# So a test instance announces nothing, installs nothing and repairs nothing. It still serves every
